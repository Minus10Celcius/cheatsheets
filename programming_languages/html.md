HTML is a __markup language__ that tells the computer to project and format the file with audio, text, etc. HTML can be used with other languages such as CSS and Javascript.

## Basics
```html
<p> P Tags! </p> 
```
P tags are paragraph tags to seperate the text into paragraphs. If you don't include the P tag, it'll just mush the text all together.
